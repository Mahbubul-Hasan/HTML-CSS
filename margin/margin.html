            <h4>Gareth Bale transfer shock</h4>
            <p>
                Bale has been heavily linked with a move to United in recent weeks with reports in Spain claiming Jose Mourinho is keen to
                push through a deal. The United boss has made no secret of his desire to sign one more wide player this summer.
                Ivan Perisic was thought to be United's No1 target but couldn't match Inter Milan's valuation and the player's
                agent expects him to remain with the Serie A club. And it seems Mourinho has turned his focus to former Tottenham
                star Bale with Real willing to listen to offers of around Â£90m.</p>
            <p>

                But the Daily Express claim Antonio Conte could scupper United's attempts to sign the Wales international. It is reported
                that Antonio Conte has targeted four more signings before the transfer window closes and Chelsea have emerged
                as serious contenders for a shock move to sign Bale. Bale has come under heavy criticism from Real fans in
                recent years following his injury woes.</p>
